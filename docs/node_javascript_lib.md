# Getting started


The Telstra SMS Messaging API allows your applications to send and receive SMS text messages from Australia's leading network operator.

It also allows your application to track the delivery status of both sent and received SMS messages.


## How to Build

The generated SDK relies on [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM) being available to resolve dependencies. If you don't already have NPM installed, please go ahead and follow instructions to install NPM from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
The SDK also requires Node to be installed. If Node isn't already installed, please install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
> NPM is installed by default when Node is installed

To check if node and npm have been successfully installed, write the following commands in command prompt:

* `node --version`
* `npm -version`

![Version Check](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=versionCheck&workspaceFolder=Telstra%20Messaging%20API-Node)

Now use npm to resolve all dependencies by running the following command in the root directory (of the SDK folder):

```bash
npm install
```

![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=resolveDependency1&workspaceFolder=Telstra%20Messaging%20API-Node)

![Resolve Dependencies](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=resolveDependency2)

This will install all dependencies in the `node_modules` folder.

Once dependencies are resolved, you will need to move the folder `TelstraMessagingAPILib ` in to your `node_modules` folder.

## How to Use

The following section explains how to use the library in a new project.

### 1. Open Project Folder
Open an IDE/Text Editor for JavaScript like Sublime Text. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

Click on `File` and select `Open Folder`.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=openFolder)

Select the folder of your SDK and click on `Select Folder` to open it up in Sublime Text. The folder will become visible in the bar on the left.

![Open Project](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=openProject&workspaceFolder=Telstra%20Messaging%20API-Node)

### 2. Creating a Test File

Now right click on the folder name and select the `New File` option to create a new test file. Save it as `index.js` Now import the generated NodeJS library using the following lines of code:

```js
var lib = require('lib');
```

Save changes.

![Create new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=createNewFile&workspaceFolder=Telstra%20Messaging%20API-Node)

![Save new file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=saveNewFile&workspaceFolder=Telstra%20Messaging%20API-Node)

### 3. Running The Test File

To run the `index.js` file, open up the command prompt and navigate to the Path where the SDK folder resides. Type the following command to run the file:

```
node index.js
```

![Run file](https://apidocs.io/illustration/nodejs?step=runProject&workspaceFolder=Telstra%20Messaging%20API-Node)


## How to Test

These tests use Mocha framework for testing, coupled with Chai for assertions. These dependencies need to be installed for tests to run.
Tests can be run in a number of ways:

### Method 1 (Run all tests)

1. Navigate to the root directory of the SDK folder from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha --recursive` to run all the tests.

### Method 2 (Run all tests)

1. Navigate to the `../test/Controllers/` directory from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha *` to run all the tests.

### Method 3 (Run specific controller's tests)

1. Navigate to the `../test/Controllers/` directory from command prompt.
2. Type `mocha  Telstra Messaging APIController`  to run all the tests in that controller file.

> To increase mocha's default timeout, you can change the `TEST_TIMEOUT` parameter's value in `TestBootstrap.js`.

## Initialization

### Authentication
In order to setup authentication in the API client, you need the following information.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| oAuthClientId | OAuth 2 Client ID |
| oAuthClientSecret | OAuth 2 Client Secret |



API client can be initialized as following:

```JavaScript
const lib = require('lib');

// Configuration parameters and credentials
lib.Configuration.oAuthClientId = "oAuthClientId"; // OAuth 2 Client ID
lib.Configuration.oAuthClientSecret = "oAuthClientSecret"; // OAuth 2 Client Secret

```

You must now authorize the client.

### Authorizing your client


This SDK uses *OAuth 2.0 authorization* to authorize the client.

The `authorize()` method will exchange the OAuth client credentials for an *access token*.
The access token is an object containing information for authorizing client requests.

 You must pass the *[scopes](#scopes)* for which you need permission to access.
```JavaScript
const tokenPromise = oAuthManager.authorize([lib.OAuthScopeEnum.NSMS]);
```
The Node.js SDK supports both callbacks and promises. So, the authorize call returns a promise and also returns response back in the callback (if one is provided)

The client can now make authorized endpoint calls.



### Scopes

Scopes enable your application to only request access to the resources it needs while enabling users to control the amount of access they grant to your application. Available scopes are defined in the `lib/Models/OAuthScopeEnum` enumeration.

| Scope Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NSMS` | NSMS |


### Storing an access token for reuse

It is recommended that you store the access token for reuse.

This code snippet stores the access token in a data store. For this example, [node-localstorage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-localstorage) is being used as the data store.
```JavaScript
const lib = require('lib');
const LocalStorage = require('node-localstorage').LocalStorage;
const localStorage = new LocalStorage('./scratch');

localStorage.setItem('token', lib.Configuration.oAuthToken);
```

### Creating a client from a stored token

To authorize a client from a stored access token, just set the access token in `Configuration` along with the other configuration parameters before making endpoint calls:

```JavaScript
// load token later...
const lib = require('lib');
const LocalStorage = require('node-localstorage').LocalStorage;
const localStorage = new LocalStorage('./scratch');

lib.Configuration.oAuthToken = localStorage.getItem('token');
```

### Complete example
In this example, `app.js` will check if the access token has been set in the SDK. If it has been, API calls can be made. Otherwise, client has to be authorized first before making API calls.  
This example makes use of [node-localstorage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-localstorage) for handling data persistence.

#### `app.js`

```JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const PORT = 1800;

const lib = require('lib');
const oAuthManager = lib.OAuthManager;
const LocalStorage = require('node-localstorage').LocalStorage;
const localStorage = new LocalStorage('./scratch');

lib.Configuration.oAuthClientId = 'oAuthClientId'; // OAuth 2 Client ID
lib.Configuration.oAuthClientSecret = 'oAuthClientSecret'; // OAuth 2 Client Secret

const storedToken = localStorage.getItem('token');
if (storedToken !== null && storedToken !== undefined) {
    lib.Configuration.oAuthToken = storedToken;
}
lib.Configuration.oAuthTokenUpdateCallback = function(token) {
    // token is the updated access_token
    localStorage.setItem('token', token);
};

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log('Listening on port ' + PORT);
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    if (oAuthManager.isTokenSet()) {
        // token is already stored in the client
        // make API calls as required
    } else {
        const scopes = [lib.OAuthScopeEnum.NSMS];
        const promise = oAuthManager.authorize(scopes);
        promise.then((success) => {
            // client authorized. API calls can be made
        }, (exception) => {
            // error occurred, exception will be of type lib/Exceptions/OAuthProviderException
        });
    }
});

```
